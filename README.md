# React Navigation Bar
This project is intended for self-practice:beginner: on creating React components and CSS styling using create-react-app. I tried avoiding using Bootstrap@React-Strap for styling to delve deeper into CSS styling itself. 

:heavy_check_mark:Available features
* Responsive navigation bar that changes into slide drawer when in mobile mode
* CSS Transition of the slide drawer

:construction:Feature to add
* Hide navbar on scroll down, and appears when scroll up
* Hide slide drawer when the region outside of the drawer is clicked

Design is inspired by [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com/).
